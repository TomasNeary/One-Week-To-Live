Dynamic Zombies (aka VariedZombies)
-----------------------------------
A mod for Project Zomboid (build 35 and 36 originally developed and tested on)

This mod was developed mainly for my own personal fun and use, and I take no credit for most it. 
This is essentially just a mash up of 2 mods I really liked:
Nocturnal Zombies by nolanritchie
and 
Restless Zombies by nolanritchie

who gets the credit for this mod.

Installation
------------
- Move "dynamic zombies" into /Users/YOURNAME/Zomboid/mods

What This Mod Does
------------------
It makes zombies more unpredictable, they will occasionally be more restless, but also can occasionally move faster than normal,
 as well as occasionally slower than normal. So a zombie can change it's speed from normal to faster, but also can then slow down again, and 
 even go slower than normal for a time. Also it may rest, or walk around a bit more. The slow/fast dynamic was added for game balance, 
 to make the game play tougher, but not really too much harder, but more unpredictable.
 *IT IS MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBLE*
 
 Settings
 --------
In both \client\ and \server\ files there are 2 settings. Change the setting in both files if you are not sure what to do:
local VZScatter=true; --turn to false to have zombies not randomly scatter
local VZDynamicSpeeds=true; --turn to false to not have zombies change speeds
